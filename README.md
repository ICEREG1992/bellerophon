**bellerophon** is a small python script which converts EmulationStation-style gamelist.xml files and scraper media folders into per-system metadata.txt files for use with the Pegasus emulation frontend. This fork of bellerophon fixes a text encoding bug with the original's boot message, allows for selecting which systems you'd like to generate metadata.txt files for (to prevent overwriting manual changes, for instance), and slightly tweaks console output.

The idea is : **multiple** folders full of games, **multiple** gamelist.xml (EmulationStation) files, **1** configuration file to determine global/per system preferences.
And one Bellerophon to kick the ass of the chimera.

> For now the script is tested and developed for the author's own use-case, i.e. Pegasus-frontend + Shield TV (Android), one `collection` (system) per metadata.txt
Modifying the script should be relatively simple as it's all contained in a single .py file, so feel free to fork and edit to your liking.

## Pegasus-frontend
[ https://pegasus-frontend.org ] or [ https://github.com/mmatyas/pegasus-frontend ]

Pegasus is a front-end to navigate in your games library. It relies on metadata.txt files that contain all data about games, paths and assets.

## What all can Bellerophon do?
Bellerophon is a Python script to :
- generate metadata files
- clean media library (unused assets). No need of the gamelist.xml for that.

## Requirements
toml >= 0.10.1

Install or upgrade pip : https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/#upgrading-pip

Module to install (TOML) : https://pypi.org/project/toml/

You can type : `pip install requirements.txt`

Or : `python -m pip install toml`

Developed in a Python 3.9.6 environment.

In order to work the script also needs :

- one `gamelist.xml` file in each system folder
- assets folder named `media` in each system foler

If `gamelist.xml` is not found, the `metadata.txt` won't be created.

**So scrape your games and ask your software to output a gamelist.xml.**

**Skraper (Screen-scraper) does that very well. :)**
[ https://www.skraper.net ]

### Please, backup your `metadata.txt` files before running the script if you're not sure what your are doing. `metadata.txt` output is overwritten each time, `gamelist.xml` is read-only.

## Usage
### Gamelist.xml
Scrape your games with Skraper (or another scraper that output an EmulationStation gamelist.xml [not tested]).
Ask for the right media folders names (they will be used as is).

### Bellerophon
1. Download `bellerophon.py` and `bellerophon.sample.conf` at the root of your library. Below the tree of my own library :

```
NVIDIA_SHIELD/
├─ bellerophon.py
├─ bellerophon.conf
└─ arcade/
    ├─ game1.zip
    ├─ game2.zip
    ├─ game3.zip
    ├─ gamelist.xml
    └─ media/
        ├─ wheel/
        |   ├─ game1.png
        |   ├─ game2.png
        |   └─ game3.png
        └─ screenshot/
            ├─ game1.png
            ├─ game2.png
            └─ game3.png
```

2. Rename `bellerophon.sample.conf` to `bellerophon.conf`
3. Edit `bellerophon.conf` according to your needs.

Add all your systems configurations. The script will skip configuration of a non existing folder/system.

4. On Desktop double-clic `bellerophon.py`.
On CLI type `py bellerophon.py`.

## bellerophon.conf
The config file consists of a global variable (for now juste the Retroarch command), and systems variables.

### global
|key|type|value|
|---|---|---|
|launch | string | A multiline command for Retroarch (Android). Edit the command to your need for Windows/Unix OS.|

### systems
#### systems.<SYSTEM_DIRECTORY_NAME>
|key|type|value|
|---|---|---|
|shortname | string | *An optional short name for the collection, often an abbreviation (like MAME, NES, etc.). Should be lowercase.* (official  documentation) |
|collection | string | *Creates a new collection with the value as name. **This is a required field.*** (official  documentation) |
|extension | string | *A comma-separated list of file extensions (without the . dot), or a list of such lines. All files with these extensions will be included.* (official  documentation) Will be a list in the future. |
|core *optional* | string | Libretro core name with *.so* extension. It will be concatenated in each metadata files. |
|launch *optional* | string | A launch command that will override the default one. So the core variable will not be used. |

## Changelog
- 18/12/2020
    + Fix master data. Now a "master" folder is created with a `metadata.txt` inside. Use that one.
- 23/09/2020
	+ Fix description with indent and linebreaks
	+ Fix bellerophon.sample.conf who had "collection" line under "shortname" line (that order doesn't work !)

- 12/07/2020
    	+ Big refactoring
    	+ Add counter to see number of games written in metadata.txt
    	+ Add "sort-by" system setting for bellerophon.conf -> see Pegasus documentation
    	+ Add "clean_media" global setting for bellerophon.conf -> check unused assets or not
    	+ Add "collections_to_clean" global setting for bellerophon.conf -> list of collections that you want to check (if None, all collections will be checked)
    	+ Add "master_data" global setting for bellerophon.conf -> create a metadta.txt at the root (that's a merge of all metadata.txt)

- 05/07/2020
	+ Initialization of the project
